# Document Upload API - 400 Error Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Category Validation Issue**
- **Problem**: The API was accepting any string for `category` but the database expects specific enum values
- **Fix**: Added validation against `VALID_CATEGORIES` array with all enum values from Prisma schema
- **Categories**: PERSONAL, PROFESSIONAL, COMPLIANCE, PAYROLL, PERFORMANCE, LEAVE, EXPENSE, TRAINING, LEGAL, MEDICAL, INSURANCE, TAX, BANK, OTHER

### 2. **Missing Title Field**
- **Problem**: Client wasn't sending `title` field, but it's required in the database
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated client to send `title` field using `document.name`
  - Made API handle missing title gracefully by using filename as fallback

### 3. **Employee ID Format Validation**
- **Problem**: No validation of employee ID format
- **Fix**: Added regex validation for cuid format (`/^[a-z0-9]{25}$/`)

### 4. **Poor Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Generic error messages made debugging difficult
- **Fix**: 
  - Added specific error handling for Prisma constraints
  - Improved client-side error display
  - Added detailed logging

### 5. **Unused Variable**
- **Problem**: `extension` variable was declared but never used
- **Fix**: Removed unused variable, kept sanitized filename generation

## Potential Remaining Issues

### 1. **Authentication**
- Ensure user is properly authenticated
- Check if session contains valid user ID

### 2. **Employee Existence**
- Verify the employee ID exists in the database
- Check if user has permission to upload documents for that employee

### 3. **File System Permissions**
- Ensure the upload directory is writable
- Check if `public/uploads/documents/` directory exists

### 4. **Database Connection**
- Verify Prisma client is properly connected
- Check if all required tables exist

## Testing Steps

1. **Check API Response**:
   ```bash
   # Check what specific error is returned
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/documents/upload \
     -F "file=@test.pdf" \
     -F "category=OTHER" \
     -F "employeeId=valid-employee-id" \
     -F "title=Test Document"
   ```

2. **Check Database**:
   ```sql
   -- Verify employee exists
   SELECT id, employeeCode, firstName, lastName FROM employees LIMIT 5;
   
   -- Check document table structure
   \d documents;
   ```

3. **Check Logs**:
   - Look at browser network tab for detailed error response
   - Check server console for error logs
   - Verify file upload progress

## Next Steps

1. Test with a valid employee ID from your database
2. Check browser network tab for the exact error response
3. Verify authentication is working properly
4. Run the test script: `node scripts/test-document-upload.js`
