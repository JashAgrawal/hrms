## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Changes

```sql
-- New tables added:
- locations (work locations with GPS coordinates)
- employee_locations (location assignments)
- attendance_requests (out-of-location check-in requests)

-- Enhanced tables:
- leave_approvals (added approverName field)
- audit_logs (enhanced with more detailed tracking)
```

### Security Features

1. **Role-Based Access Control:**
   - Only Admin/HR can manage locations
   - Only Admin can view audit logs
   - Managers can approve attendance requests for their team

2. **Geo-Fencing Security:**
   - GPS coordinate validation
   - Distance calculation using Haversine formula
   - Configurable radius per location

3. **Audit Trail:**
   - Complete action logging
   - IP address and user agent tracking
   - Immutable audit records

### API Security

- All endpoints require authentication
- Role-based permission checks
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention with Prisma

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Database Migration

Run the migration script to update your database:

```bash
# Push schema changes
npx prisma db push

# Or create a migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-geofencing-and-audit-features

# Run the setup script
npx tsx scripts/migrate-schema.ts
```

### 2. Configure Locations

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/locations` as an admin
2. Add your work locations with GPS coordinates
3. Set appropriate radius for each location
4. Assign locations to employees

### 3. Test Geo-Fencing

1. Try checking in from outside assigned locations
2. Verify attendance request workflow
3. Test manager approval process

### 4. Monitor System Activity

1. Access audit logs at `/dashboard/audit-logs` as admin
2. Filter by actions, resources, users, or date ranges
3. Monitor security events and user activities

## üì± Mobile Experience

The system is fully responsive and works on mobile devices:

- Mobile-friendly location detection
- Touch-optimized punch buttons
- Responsive audit log interface
- Mobile location assignment
